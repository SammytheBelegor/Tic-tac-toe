# Tic-tac-toe
A broad game played and admired by many and written in java. It contains a simple code but the main interest is in gameplay so i hope nothing wrong about it.
The text editor used for creating this game is eclipse workspace
It took a lot of time to set all the  color, font, size etc. stuff but it is done. 
A simple codedd game that could be fun for playing a few rounds. Mainly there were no hard parts because all the parts of the code are basic.

The game and the rules are like in the classic tic tac toe. The goal to set all the marks in a row faster than the opponent.
Have fun!
